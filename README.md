### Hi there 👋

WordPress, TV Series, music, and kids. I think that's probably the best way to define me in a few words. 🙂 I try to keep up with issues in all my repos, so if you have questions about some of my work, don't hesitate to reach out.

### On my blog

Here is my take on an important part of a developer’s job, code reviews: [The Power of a Conversational Code Review Culture](https://jeremy.hu/the-power-of-a-conversational-code-review-culture/). 👓

I also wrote about JavaScript GitHub Actions:

- [Intro to building our own JavaScript Action inside an existing project, to automatically add labels to newly opened issues.](https://jeremy.hu/github-actions-build-javascript-action-part-1/)
- [Leverage GitHub Issue forms and build your own GitHub Action to automate priority assignment on your issues.](https://jeremy.hu/github-actions-build-javascript-action-part-2/)
